Sunny Spot Holidays â€“ Database Design and Implementation

**Project Overview:**
This project aimed to enhance the online presence and operational efficiency of Sunny Spot Holidays by developing a robust database system. The new system dynamically manages and displays cabin information and promotions, replacing the outdated reliance on downloadable PDFs and manually managed Word documents.

**Key Deliverables:**

1. ERD Diagram:
Designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database structure, illustrating the relationships between tables such as Cabins, CabinInclusions, and Promotions.

2. Data Dictionary:
Created a comprehensive data dictionary to define each field's data type, constraints, and relationships, ensuring clear and structured data management.

3. Database Creation:
Implemented the database using Microsoft SQL Server, leveraging its scalability and reliability. The database supports dynamic cabin information display and efficient promotional data management.

4.Data Insertion and Testing:
Inserted sample data into the database and performed thorough testing to verify data integrity and system functionality. This included testing data retrieval, insertion, and updating processes.

5.Querying:
Developed SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data, providing valuable insights and facilitating the dynamic display of cabin information and promotions on the website.

**Tools and Technologies:**
Database Management System: Microsoft SQL Server
Data Modeling and Visualization: draw.io
Hosting Solutions: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Monitoring and Analytics: Power BI

**Success Criteria:**
Dynamic Information Display: Achieved real-time dynamic presentation of cabin information on the website, eliminating the need for PDF downloads.
Efficient Promotional Management: Developed a system to store, manage, and display promotions effectively, including varying discounts per cabin.
Scalability and Security: Ensured the system's scalability and security, handling increased user traffic without downtime and protecting user data through encryption and secure access controls.
